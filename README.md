# Shelter

It was [a study project](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage1/stream1/shelter/README.md) on [RSSchool Stage1](https://rs.school/js/) course. The project included 3 stages:

Create fixed layout. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage1/stream1/shelter/README.md#%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F-1)
Add adaptive on screens 320...767px, 768px...1279, 1280...and more. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage1/stream1/shelter/README.md#%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F-2)
Add interactives with JavaScript (the slider with generation of random (but not repeating) cards, pagination, popup). Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/stage1/stream1/shelter/README.md#%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8F-3)

During the Code review process this solution got maximum points.
